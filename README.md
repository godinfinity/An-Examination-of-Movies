# An-Examination-of-Movies

We wished to take a deeper dive into movies and film history. Intuitively, we all have an understanding of what movies we enjoy and don’t enjoy as well as at least a cursory level of knowledge with film history and the mass of movies that have been made. The means of investigation detailed in this paper are largely through the use of visualizations: with graphs and tables. We also created a model which recommends movies similar to an input movie. This is achieved by itemizing details of a film (director, genre, description, etc) and finding its cosine similarity compared to other films. The lower the cosine similarity, the more similar the films are and, therefore, it’s likely that a person who enjoyed the input movie would enjoy the output movies as well.
